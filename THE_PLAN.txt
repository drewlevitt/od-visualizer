At the top, a sentence with drop-down menus: "Show trips [to|from] [zone] by [mode] during the [day type] [day part]. [Reset]"
    What if we don't have fully symmetrical OD data? like some zones only have origin data and others only have destination data? Or is this a dumb edge case that's not worth handling? (Probably.)
        For now let's insist that o_name and d_name MUST contain all the same unique values.
    Clicking "Reset" just sets [zone] to "none." Then handle that.
    
Guide: "Use the drop-down menus to select travel mode, direction, and time period. You can also select a zone for analysis using the drop-down, or click a zone on the map to select it."

On mouseover a given polygon: tooltip: "[Zone name]: click to select this zone for analysis." If there is already a selection, also show "[Day type] [day part] [mode] trips from [selected zone|this zone] to [this zone|selected zone]: [num_trips] ([pct] of all [outbound|inbound] [mode] trips)"


I think we can handle the dropdowns uniformly via something like:
var options = {direction: 'inbound', ...}
d3.selectAll("select")
    .on("change", function(e) {
        options[e.target.name] = e.target.value;
        updateMap(options);
    });
but I can't confirm the exact syntax of the event handler so we'll just have to try it in practice :-P


It would be easiest if we can just use the human-readable zone names AS the zone IDs. We would need to enforce uniqueness among these names (which usually seems like a good idea) and we might need to restrict the use of certain characters, which would probably not be a huge problem in practice, but might be difficult to figure out exactly WHAT the restrictions are (!).
    quotes (that match the quote type wrapping the string). using backticks (technically creating template literals) might effectively dodge this problem
    Alternatively, zones could have [alpha]numeric IDs, stored as 'id' under each 'Feature', and also have human-readable names, stored as 'name' under each 'Feature''s 'properties'. And the flow table would have o_id, o_name, d_id, and d_name. Use the _name fields to populate 
    
We will need to procedurally generate cutpoints for a given set of selections. Think we should use quantiles - probably quintiles specifically
    d3.scaleQuantile
quantile = d3.scaleQuantile()
  .domain(data) // pass the whole dataset to a scaleQuantileâ€™s domain
  .range(["white", "pink", "red"]) // or a range of colors equal in length to the number of quantiles desired
    I think we can just recalculate `quantile` every time a selection changes, and that'll be that, right?!
    We may need to map.removeLayer and layer.addTo(map) every time... we'll see
    layer.setStyle would seem to help bigtime
  //For each feature, returns the styling
  function mapStyle(feature) {
    return {
        fillColor: getColor(feature),
        color: 'black', opacity: 1, weight: 0.5,
        opacity: 1,
        fillOpacity: 0.8,
    };
  }
  
  //Whenever called, styles the map
  function colorMap() {
    if(!overlay)
      return;
    //preprocess();
    overlay.setStyle(mapStyle);
  }
  
GeoJSON spec:
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[[x0, y0], [x1, y1]]]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Dinagat Islands"
  }
}




How to handle zero-volume flows?
    Could fill with 0 BEFORE recalculating quantile cutpoints, but this would usually result in a ton of 0s that will fill up the bottom bucket
    I want to have zero-volume polygons be transparent - still draw the border but have no fill color.
    And then I want to apply quantiles to only non-zero volume polygons, and fill them with the corresponding colors.

How to associate CSV data with the Leaflet features?
    Why don't I use d3 to filter the full CSV down to only relevant rows, then... create a dictionary so that Leaflet features can efficiently look up their corresponding values in the dictionary? (JS object property lookups are basically O(1).)
    And, what, do I have a dictionary of colors too? No, right? I just have a d3 quantile scale that I wrap in a handler for if the Leaflet feature's value is `undefined`

Do I need to add the GeoJSON layer to the Leaflet map only after loading the flows CSV data - i.e. within the d3.csv() block?? (Seems like yes.)
